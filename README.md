# Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project uses the **Iris dataset** to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical features using **Logistic Regression**. The dataset consists of measurements for sepals and petals, and the goal is to classify the species into three types: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**.

## Installation

To get started, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your `requirements.txt` contains the following dependencies:

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   The Iris dataset can be accessed through various sources. One of the common places to get it is via the `sklearn` library:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
data = load_iris()
```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Split the dataset into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and target (species).

3. **Train the Logistic Regression Model**:
   Use the **Logistic Regression** algorithm from Scikit-learn to classify the flower species based on the features.

4. **Make Predictions**:
   After training, use the model to predict the species of new flower data.

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Logistic Regression Model**: A simple yet powerful classification algorithm used to predict flower species.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes accuracy and other evaluation metrics for classification performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to help understand the classification results.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and evaluation.

## Model Overview

The **Logistic Regression** model used in this project is a simple yet effective classifier for this multi-class classification problem. Logistic Regression is typically used for binary classification, but it can be extended to multi-class classification using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR).

### Model Workflow:
1. **Input Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
2. **Output**: Predicted Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the Iris dataset.
4. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model predicts the species based on input features.

### Example of Logistic Regression Training:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

## Examples

### Predicting Species for New Data

Once the model is trained, you can predict the species for new iris flowers based on their physical features:

```python
# New data: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
new_data = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Example of Iris-setosa flower

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

# Output the predicted species
print(f"Predicted species: {data.target_names[prediction]}")
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Model performance is low**: If the model is not performing well, try adjusting the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model, such as the regularization strength `C`.
- **Data issues**: Ensure that the data is clean and appropriately preprocessed, without missing values.
- **Runtime errors**: Check if the dependencies are correctly installed and ensure compatibility between them.
